# History of React

React is a javascript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook in 2011. React has many competitors such as Angular, Vue and Svelte. React is all about components. Components are individual chunks of interfaces. Most useful way of using components is that we can make individual resuable components. Changing the data and/pr layout of one component will not break down the entire app. React uses virtual DOM due to which only the component that has to be changed is effected instead of the entire app. So only some specific parts of the webpage are reloaded instead of the whole page which makes the React app much faster than the traditional HTML.
